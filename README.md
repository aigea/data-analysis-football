# Data Analysis of Football players and matches

> Exploring interesting research questions about football players and matches dataset (2008 - 2016)

## Introduction

As a football fan, it was not hard to choose between the datasets provided for this project. Picking the most interesting research questions, however, was much more difficult: with dozens of variables for matches, teams and individual players, there are literally hundreds of questions to answer. 


## Exploratory Data Analysis

For the datasets used, I will answer the following research questions:

1. Is there an advantage for teams playing in their own stadium (home advantage)?

2. How did the Spanish football club Barcelona perform over the years, compared to its main competitor Real Madrid?

3. Are there more professional football players born in the first months of the year than in the last months of the year (relative age effect)?

4. Are there player characteristics that correspond to higher overall rating in the EA Sports FIFA video game?


### Prerequisites

This project uses [Python](https://www.python.org). You may download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) to visualize and run the iPython notebook with Jupyter Notebooks.
